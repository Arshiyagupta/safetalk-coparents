        <h1>Audio & Video Calling FAQ</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2026</p>

        <p>SafeTalk offers secure audio and video calling to help co-parents communicate more effectively. This page answers common questions about how calling works.</p>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How do I enable calling?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>To enable calling:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to your <strong>Profile</strong> screen</li>
                    <li>Tap <strong>Calling Settings</strong></li>
                    <li>Toggle on <strong>Audio Calling</strong> and/or <strong>Video Calling</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>You can enable audio calling, video calling, or both independently.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Why can't I call my co-parent?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Calling in SafeTalk requires <strong>mutual consent</strong>. Both you AND your co-parent must enable calling before calls can be placed. This ensures both parties are comfortable with voice/video communication.</p>
                <p>If you've enabled calling but can't make calls, your co-parent may not have enabled it yet on their end.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Is my phone number shared with my co-parent?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p><strong>No.</strong> SafeTalk calls use internet-based (VoIP) technology. Your phone number is never shared with your co-parent. Calls are made entirely through the SafeTalk app using your internet connection (WiFi or cellular data).</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Call Recording</h2>

        <div class="legal-notice">
            <h3>Important: Recording Consent Laws</h3>
            <p>Recording laws vary by location. Some states and countries require <strong>all parties</strong> to consent before a conversation can be recorded. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>United States:</strong> California, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington</li>
                <li><strong>Other countries:</strong> Many countries have similar all-party consent requirements</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>By using call recording, you confirm that you understand and will comply with all applicable recording consent laws in your jurisdiction.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How does call recording work?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Call recording in SafeTalk requires <strong>consent from both parties</strong>:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Both you and your co-parent must enable "Allow Call Recording" in your Calling Settings</li>
                    <li>When both parties have consented, a recording option becomes available during calls</li>
                    <li>A clear indicator shows when recording is active</li>
                    <li>Either party can stop recording at any time</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Why would I want to record calls?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Call recordings can be useful for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Keep a record of agreements made during calls</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal purposes:</strong> Provide evidence for court proceedings if needed</li>
                    <li><strong>Reference:</strong> Review details of conversations about schedules, expenses, or child-related decisions</li>
                    <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Encourage respectful communication when both parties know the call may be recorded</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Where are recordings stored?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Call recordings are stored securely on SafeTalk's servers. Only the participants of the call can access the recordings. Recordings are retained indefinitely and may be used as documentation for legal or court proceedings.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Can I delete a recording?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>You can delete recordings from your own view. However, because recordings may be needed for legal documentation, the other party's copy of the recording is not affected when you delete yours.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Privacy & Safety</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Are calls encrypted?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes. All SafeTalk calls use industry-standard encryption to protect your conversations during transmission. We use Agora's secure real-time communication infrastructure.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Can I disable calling if I no longer want to receive calls?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes. You can disable calling at any time:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to your <strong>Profile</strong> screen</li>
                    <li>Tap <strong>Calling Settings</strong></li>
                    <li>Toggle off <strong>Audio Calling</strong> and/or <strong>Video Calling</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Once disabled, your co-parent will not be able to call you until you re-enable the feature.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What if my co-parent is using calls to harass me?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>If you feel uncomfortable with calls:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Disable calling</strong> in your settings - your co-parent cannot call you once disabled</li>
                    <li><strong>Document the behavior</strong> - if calls were recorded, these can serve as evidence</li>
                    <li><strong>Report the issue</strong> - contact us at info@safetalk-coparent.com</li>
                    <li><strong>Seek legal help</strong> - if harassment continues, consult with a legal professional</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Technical Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What do I need for calls to work?</div>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Internet connection:</strong> WiFi or cellular data (4G/5G recommended for video)</li>
                    <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> You must grant SafeTalk access to your microphone (for audio calls) and camera (for video calls)</li>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Why is my call quality poor?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Call quality depends on your internet connection. Try these tips:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use WiFi instead of cellular data when possible</li>
                    <li>Move closer to your WiFi router</li>
                    <li>Close other apps that may be using bandwidth</li>
                    <li>Switch from video to audio-only if video is choppy</li>
                    <li>Check that no one else on your network is streaming video or downloading large files</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes! SafeTalk's video calling feature can be used for virtual visitation, allowing you to see and talk with your children when they're with your co-parent. Both parents must have calling enabled for this to work.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
